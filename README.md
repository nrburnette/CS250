# CS250
SNHU CS250 class project

README
This is my github portfolio for SNHU CS250 Software Lifecycle Development class.  The final project is attached and involves an imaginary reflection on a project done for SNHU Travel.  I took role as Scrum Master for ChadaTech.
UPDATE TO README:
I am answering these questions from Module 8:
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?

Answer: Gather detailed information from the user, determine the complexity of the needs. The greater the
complexity and uncertainty, the more a Scrum-agile approach is likely needed.

How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Answer: User Stories are effectively the points the program needs to hit. The ability to see descriptions of vacations
is a user story, the ability to click on that description to go somewhere is a story. Assembly of stories is an
outline or to-do list.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Answer: The answer to this depends upon your position or role. If you are the product owner, you start by gathering
detailed information. If you are the Scrum Master, you help the product owner compile user stories into a
backlog plan of attack. If you are a developer, you aim to fully understand the needs of those backlog items
and you present your questions ahead of time so that you can be most efficient during sprints. For me, I
assume I will be a developer at first, my goal will be to fail early and often!

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Answer: Someone who is committed to the agreed values and approaches of the team will be a good team member.
You may not have experience at the beginning but if you work with the values of a Scrum-agile system
instead of trying to ignore them, you will open yourself up better to the positive outcomes Scrum-agile can
provide. This is in addition to personal integrity, being to work on time, being honest, and other standard
core values any employer would look for.
